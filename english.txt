*********
You wake up feeling dizzy with your cheek on the sand. You can't remember why you're lying down.
You try to stand up, but suddenly, a man wielding a sword attacks you. You quickly dodge his
attack, and in a flash, you notice his outfit. His body is covered in clothes that shimmer under
the sun, and his lower garment is as red as blood. His skin is as lively as the morning sand.
That's when you realize you're fighting for your Datu, and the man attacking you is the enemy.
The enemy prepares for a second attack while you glance around, searching for a weapon. To your
left, there is a sword and a wooden shield.

<//>

<001-ATT>
=========
Using only your hand, you punch the enemy in the nose. You land a solid blow, and now his nose
is bleeding. You try to punch him again, this time on the left cheek, and it connects. You
strike again, hitting his right cheek. The punch lands. The enemy seems dazed from your
repeated punches. On your final strike, you aim at his clothing. As you punch, you feel pain
because his garment is as hard as stone. Why are these strangers wearing stone? The enemy sees
that you're hurt from your punch and seizes the opportunity. He slices your arm and then stabs
his sword into your side. That's when you realize you made the wrong decision.

<//>

<001-DEF>
=========
The enemy attacks again. In your fear, you try to defend yourself with your arms. You sustain
cuts on both arms, and deep wounds form. You try to stay calm and grab both the shield and
sword lying in the sand. You prepare to defend against the enemy's next attack. Seconds later,
he attacks again. You raise your shield, ready to block the strike, and it hits. The enemy
keeps attacking, hoping to land a blow on your hand, but he can't get through your defense.
After a moment, you notice the enemy losing balance, perhaps stumbling over scattered weapons.
You don't let this chance pass and strike him with your sword, hitting his neck.

<//>

<001-DDG>
=========
The enemy attacks again. You knew he would, so you quickly dodge toward the shield and sword.
You grab the shield and brace for his next attack. On the third attack, you feel the force of
his strike, but you don't back down. While his sword is still pressed against your shield,
you slice his hand. He screams in pain. Now, with the enemy unarmed and unable to defend
himself, you finish him off with a cut to his neck.

<//>

<002-002>
*********
In the distance, you see your comrade struggling against an invader. He seems to be having a
hard time fighting this enemy. You step forward to help, but you're stopped by a sound. It's
the sound of a bow releasing an arrow. You look around to find the source and glance upward,
seeing a rain of arrows heading toward you. You now have two choices: defend against the
arrows or run to help your comrade.

<//>

<002-ATT>
=========
You sprint toward your comrade. Arrows rain down from the sky. It's a miracle you haven't
been hit yet, until one grazes both of your arms. You stop momentarily from the pain of your
wounds, but you know more arrows are coming your way, so you keep running. Eventually, you
reach the invader attacking your comrade. His back is turned, fully focused on your comrade.
You wound both of his legs. The enemy screams in pain and turns to face you. While he's
distracted, your comrade strikes him from behind with his sword. The attack isn't effective,
likely due to the invader's armor. But you don't give him a chance to retaliate, and you
slice his throat.

<//>

<002-DEF>
=========
You stop and crouch to shield your body with your shield. After five seconds, the rain of
arrows stops. You quickly run toward your comrade and charge at the enemy with your shield.
The enemy falls, and your comrade swiftly strikes him on the back of the neck with his
sword. A large gash is left from the blow, and the enemy finally dies.

<//>

<002-DDG>
=========
You try to dodge the arrows. You don't know what came over you to make this choice. At
first, you avoid some of the arrows, but there are too many, and you can’t dodge them all.
The first arrow hits your thigh, the second your right arm, the third strikes your left
cheek. You try to run to avoid the fourth, but your deep thigh wound worsens with every
step. The fourth arrow strikes your head. You fall to the ground, eyes wide open. It's
painful to know that the last thing you see is your comrades fighting the invaders, not
your Datu’s victory.

<//>

<003-003>
*********
Having saved your brother from his fate, you now wanted to help your other kin in the
battle to finally end it. But before you could take a step, someone attacked you from
behind. You felt the sting of a fresh wound. Your brother did not let this go and
retaliated, but the enemy quickly defended himself. Your brother launched a flurry of
attacks, but all were blocked. Suddenly, another enemy appeared behind him. That’s when
your brother’s valiant fight came to an end. It hurt deeply to see his story end here,
but you were in the middle of a battle between your Datu and the invaders, so you had no
time to grieve. Two against one was not a fair fight for you. You thought of fighting,
but with the wound on your back and both arms, you weren’t sure you could win. Perhaps
running away was the wiser choice.

<//>

<003-ATT>
=========
You thought about running, but what kind of warrior runs from a battle? A coward, that’s
who. Even though the odds weren’t in your favor, you tried to fight. You struck first,
catching them by surprise. You slashed the face of the first enemy, the one who cut your
back. The second enemy retaliated, but you blocked with your shield. To your left, you saw
the first enemy bleeding from his face. Enraged, the first enemy attacked again while you
were defending against the second, but you could still defend yourself with your sword.
Your focus was on the first enemy’s attacks, and you didn’t notice that the second one was
about to strike. Realizing this, you quickly dropped your defense against the first enemy
to block the second with your sword. However, this left you open, and the first enemy
stabbed you in the back. You saw the tip of his sword protruding from your chest. Perhaps
running would have been the right choice.

<//>

<003-DEF>
=========
You tried to let them attack first, planning to defend and then counterattack. At first,
it worked: the first enemy struck, and you cut his hand. But the wound wasn’t deep enough to
defeat him. The second enemy attacked immediately, and you defended, intending to counter, but
the first enemy struck again, forcing you to remain on the defensive. Both enemies kept
attacking while you hid behind your shield until it finally broke. You closed your eyes,
bracing for the next strikes, and didn’t know what happened next. When you looked back, the
enemies were walking away from you. You tried to follow them, but as you took a step, you
collapsed. That’s when you noticed two swords embedded in your chest. Lying in the sand, you
gazed upon the battlefield where your brothers still fought. Many of them were in the same
position as you—lying down, unable to fight. But others were still fighting for your Datu
and your land. You knew your Datu and your brothers would win this battle, so you entrusted
the fight to them.

<//>

<003-DDG>
=========
You rammed the second enemy with your shield and ran away. The second enemy fell, but you left
your shield with him. Perhaps that was the right decision because now you had nothing heavy to
carry. You saw the first enemy chasing after you, but he was slow, and it seemed he was running
out of breath.

<//>

<004-004>
*********
While running, you spotted a spear. Its shaft was made of bamboo, and its head was made of stone,
a great weapon for long-distance combat. This was the perfect opportunity to attack the enemy
chasing you with the spear.

<//>

<004-ATT>
=========
You grabbed the spear and threw it at the enemy chasing you. He saw you throw it and tried to run away,
but he was too slow to avoid it. The spear hit him in the back, piercing through to his chest. You
approached the spear while keeping your eye on the second enemy. He was just getting up when he saw what
had happened. Knowing he was next, he tried to stand and run. At that moment, you retrieved the spear,
ready to throw it at the second enemy. You threw it as he crawled in fear. Soon, it hit his leg, pinning
him to the ground, and blood gushed from his wound. Knowing he wouldn’t last much longer, you didn’t waste
any more time on him.

<//>

<004-DEF>
=========
You paused briefly with the spear behind you and let the enemy get closer. When he was near, you stabbed
his foot with the spear, pinning him to the ground. You then struck him with your sword, but it wasn’t
effective. A small spark flew as your sword made contact with his armor, like the spark you see when two
stones are struck together. Could his armor be made of stone? Nonetheless, his foot is still stuck on the
ground. You see that nothing is obstructed in his face so you slice him there and then you stabbed him in
the neck. The second enemy fell short from the hands of one of your brother, perhaps they attacked him when
he was down when you rammed him.

<//>

<004-DDG>
=========
You avoided this spear because you thought it wouldn't be effective against them. While dodging the spear,
you found a bow and arrows. A lot of arrows were scattered on the sand, and these weren't like the ones you
used. The heads of these arrows were as shiny as the invaders' armor. Perhaps both were made from the same
materials. You used the bow and arrows to hit an enemy positioned at a distance. You aimed the arrow to
strike his leg, then released it. The enemy was unaware as the arrow descended from the sky. It hit his leg,
and he screamed in pain. You picked up another arrow and aimed it at his headgear. It struck, and the enemy
fell. You took another arrow, this time targeting a second enemy—your chance to avenge your sibling. You
pulled the bowstring, aimed at the enemy's direction, and released it. You watched as the arrow descended
toward the enemy, anger filling your thoughts. Like the first enemy, the arrow hit the second one's headgear.

<//>

<005-005>
*********
Not far away, you saw the invaders preparing to flee, while some had already set sail away from the battle
in their boats. Using the bow you found, you tried to shoot arrows at a few of them, but on your right, you
noticed a man planning to burn down the hut where you were staying. Two choices were before you: defend your
home or attack the enemies sailing away.

<//>

<005-ATT>
=========
You ignored the man and continued shooting arrows at those aboard the ship sailing away from the battle.
You hit a few, but many of the arrows you used missed, while your hut was completely burned down. The man
quickly ran toward the sea, probably to escape after what he did. Your brothers chased after him to make
him pay for burning your home. He didn't reach the ships sailing away from the battle; that’s when your
brothers caught up to him and worked together to bring him down.

<//>

<005-DEF>
=========
You defended your hut face-to-face using your sword, but you were defeated in this fight. The man
successfully burned down your hut. In your final moments, you saw your brothers chasing after him. Perhaps
they would avenge your death. As you thought about this, you collapsed to the ground and took your final rest.

<//>

<005-DDG>
=========
You avoided both choices by sitting down in the sand, tired and exhausted. You decided to rest for a while.
After all, you could build a new hut if you wanted to. As you lay on the ground, you saw your hut burning and
the man responsible for the fire running from your brothers, who were chasing him, ready to kill him. A few
minutes passed, and your brothers worked together to bring down the lone man. Your eyes witnessed their rage
toward him.

<//>

<END-END>
*********
The invaders successfully escaped. Your brothers and the Datu triumphed in this battle, but many of your
brothers had to sacrifice their lives for this victory. You also knew that these invaders would return to
avenge their fallen comrades. This would not be your last battle. But for now, you were the victors, and
that was what mattered. If they planned to return, your Datu would be ready to face them in battle again.
As long as your Datu lived, they would not win any battle they chose to fight.
